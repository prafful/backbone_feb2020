1. Create the required Backbone view to display a list of 
    Vehicles/Cars. Add 6 models to collection!
2. Each Vehicle/Car should be displayed as an <li> with the 
    "class" vehicle. 
3. Inside the <li>: Display the registration number, 
    followed by a button called "Delete".
4. When the delete button is clicked, remove the 
    corresponding <li> from the collection and DOM
    respectively.
5. Add model to the given collection using .add() or .push() 
    method, which in turn should update the view with 
    updated collection!
